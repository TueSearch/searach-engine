# Crawler manager, backend, etc. set up

1. Tear down everything

```bash
./scripts/tear_down.sh
```

2. Start the project. If the project starts for the first time, run 

```bash
./scripts/start_up.sh bootstrap
```

Any further time

```bash
./scripts/start_up.sh
```

3. Run the crawler

```bash
./scripts/start_crawlers.sh 2
```

Change the number `2` to the number of crawlers you want to start. Start slowly and increase the number of crawlers
gracefully to see if everything works fine. Be polite to other websites and use at most `4` crawlers at the same time to avoid overloading the crawled websites.

4. Stop the crawler

```bash
./scripts/stop_crawlers.sh
```

# Frontend

1. Set up the mock API 
```bash
docker-compose up --build backend_mockup_server
```
and test the API at `localhost:4001/search?q=tubingen`.

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the frontend

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open the browser at `http://localhost:5000/`
